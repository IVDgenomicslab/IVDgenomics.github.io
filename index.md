## Summary

[scDetect](https://github.com/IVDgenomicslab/scDetect/) is a new ensemble learning method which combines gene expression rank-based analysis and a majority vote ensemble machine-learning probability-based prediction method capable of highly accurate classification of cells based on scRNA-seq data by different sequencing platforms.

## Application of scDetect

## Training step

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/IVDgenomicslab/scDetect.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
