## Summary

[scDetect](https://github.com/IVDgenomicslab/scDetect/) is a new cell type ensemble learning classification method for single-cell RNA sequencing across different data platforms, using a combination of gene expression rank-based method and majority vote ensemble machine-learning probability-based prediction method.
To further accurate predict the tumor cells in the single cell RNA-seq data, we developed scDetect-Cancer, a classification framework which incorporated the cell copy number information and epithelial origin information in the classification.

## Application of scDetect

First, we load the scPred package

## Training step

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/IVDgenomicslab/scDetect.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
